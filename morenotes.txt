Accordingly, VO2max could be predicted with a 5MT using the equation VO2max = 16.6 + (8.87 × 5-min relative power output).

// v02 max estimate from running

VO2max = 100.162 + 7.301 × gender (1 = male; 0 = female) − 0.164 × body mass (kg) − 1.273 × elapsed exercise time − 0.156 × exercise heart rate
